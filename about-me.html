            <p>At my core, I'm a problem-solver. I like figuring out how things work, and using that knowledge to make them better.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I graduated from the University of Toronto (UofT) in 2021 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. UofT's coursework was broad, and exposed me to a wide range of topics within
                mechanical engineering (e.g., fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, manufacturing, solid mechanics, etc.). During my time at school, I became particularly interested in renewable energy
                and energy systems; as a result, many of my elective courses were focused on the energy, such a <em>Alternative Energy Systems</em>, <em>Energy Policy</em>, and 
                <em>Introduction to Fusion Energy</em>. Furthermore, my growing interest in sustainability led me to join the Sustainable Engineers Association (SEA) in my second year, which I remained
                an executive at for the duration of my time at UofT. While part of SEA, I helped organize sustainability-focused events, including an annual career fair.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>My interests in energy and sustainability carried over from my university days to my career, and they have helped guide the workplaces I've chosen since then. While
                still a student, I did a 1-year internship at the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), a Crown Corporation that oversees Ontario's power system. After graduating, I worked on the 
                innovation team at Alectra Utilities, where I helped to design pilot projects to test the feasibility of implementing clean energy technologies. And most recently, I've been a Mechatronics Engineer 
                at ReDeTec, a startup that is seeking to make plastic recycling cheaper, more sustainable, and accessible on a small-scale basis.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>Outside of work and school, I liked to spend much of my free time playing music, keeping myself healthy, and experimenting in the kitchen. After a recent trip to Switzerland, I've 
                also become more interested in languages, and am slowly working my way through Duolingo's German course. </p>
