            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>At my core, I'm an engineer. I like understanding how things work, and using that knowledge to make them better.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2021 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. My coursework specialized in <em>Mechatronics</em> and 
                <em>Energy & the Environment</em>, and I completed an additional <em>Minor in Sustainable Energy</em> and <em>Certificate in Engineering Business</em>. I was involved
                with several design teams and clubs, most prominently the Sustainable Engineers Association.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a mechanical engineer, I'm familiar with a handful of computer-aided design (CAD) softwares and simulation tools (primarily in the fluid dynamics realm). 
                I'm also experienced with rapid manufacturing and small-scale prototyping, including both in terms of mechanical design and basic electronics.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the workplace, I have often had to push myself beyond just being a mechanical engineer, and as a result have become quite adept with a wide range of programming languages 
                and software topics. I am frequently my team's "go-to" data analytics person, likely due to my naturally analytical way of approaching problem-solving.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While a student at the University of Toronto, I received several awards for academic achievement; I was also part of a capstone design team in my final year that won the 
                <em>John W. Senders Award for Imaginative Design</em>, which is awarded to each year's top medical design project.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I received a <em>Certificate of Basic Machining</em> after completing a two-day course at George Brown College, in which I learned the basics of operating a lathe and mill.
                I also studied for and passed a 3D-modeling course that tested competency using SolidWorks.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Outside of work and school, I liked to spend much of my free time playing music, keeping myself healthy, and experimenting in the kitchen. After a recent trip to Switzerland, I've 
                also become more interested in languages, and am slowly working my way through Duolingo's German course. </p>
