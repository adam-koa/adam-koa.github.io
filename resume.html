                    <p>I worked on Kinectrics' Piping Design team, providing engineering consulting services to nuclear power plants in Ontario.
                        Key clients included Bruce Power and Ontario Power Generation (OPG).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My responsibilities consisted of performing mechanical design work for modifications to systems within the plant. I prepared 
                        documentation to satisfy engineering change control requirements for all stages of the design process, from conceptual to 
                        detailed design stages.

                    </ul>
                    <p>Despite entering the nuclear industry with minimal relevant experience, I was able to learn quickly and take on increased
                        responsibility within a few months. I became acquainted with relevant nuclear and non-nuclear standards, including CSA N285.0, CSA B51,
                        ASME BPVC, and ASME 31.1.

                <div class="resume-content">
                    <p>ReDeTec developed and manufactured plastic recycling technology, primarily focused on the 3d-printing space. With a ProtoCycler, a business or hobbyist could 
                        reuse a single spool of filament several times, recycling the old to make the new.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I worked on ReDeTec's research & development team as a jack-of-all-trades mechanical engineer. I designed mechanical and electronics systems, regularly 
                        using software tools to create 3d-models or run fluid dynamics simulations. Once designed, I performed additonal analyses to gauge feasibility,
                        including with respect to possible failure modes, manufacturability, and cost. I also procured selected designs from off-the-shelf suppliers or through custom manufacturing 
                        (e.g., 3d-printing, CNC machining), built testing rigs for prototypes, and frequently participated in design validation testing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In addition to my mechanical engineering responsibilities, I was also ReDeTec's <em>de-facto</em> software engineer and data analyst. Using Java, I developed a major revision 
                        of the ProtoCycler's control software, which improved performance and added new features. I also created a back-end system that linked the client-side Java program with an 
                        AWS database and Shopify system, in order to automatically control access to subscription-based software. I regularly incorporated Python scripts into the R&D team's workflow, 
                        creating tools to streamline the process of analyzing testing data. Finally, I coded micro-controller firmware in C++ to control a cooling fan based on thermocouple temperature readings.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Because of ReDeTec's startup nature, miscellaneous tasks frequently arose for which I claimed responsibility: the most prominent of these was the management of the company's 
                        digital advertising. Starting with no knowledge of marketing and learning on the fly through online courses and tutorials, I developed advertising campaigns in 
                        Google and LinkedIn.

                    <p>I worked on Alectra's innovation team, which is known as the <em>Green Energy & Technology (GRE&T) Centre</em>. Our mandate was to identify emerging technologies in the energy sector, evaluate 
                        their potential, develop pilot projects, and ultimately help Alectra stay on the forefront of the clean energy transition.</p>

                        homeowners, who had been provided with solar panels, battery storage, and (in some cases) electric vehicle chargers for their homes. I oversaw the daily operation of these systems using 
                        virtual power plant software, troubleshooted when issues arose, and coordinate repairs as needed. I also performed monthly analysis of the project data, calculating energy, cost, and

                    <p>As a utility company with over a million customers, Alectra had access to enormous amounts of data. I used data science and machine learning to create analytics tools
                        that could harness this data, and help improve operational efficiency for Alectra's asset management team. Furthermore, I managed data sharing requests from internal and external
                        stakeholders, ensuring that Alectra was able to fulfill requests in a timely manner without compromising cyber-security.
